                <p>I created this portfolio to showcase the work I've done both inside and outside of
                    university, highlighting my ability to turn ideas into software applications.</p>

                <p>This was built within a virtual environment where I developed and tested my
                    application on a local server before deployment. This also meant I could
                    keep this project, and its dependencies separate from other projects on my system.</p>

                <p>I organised the files in a folder system, specifically between static and template
                    to create not only an organised structure for myself during development, but to keep
                    the assets that do not change dynamically away from the HTML pages that rely on the
                    backend and user interactions.</p>

                <p>The Flask framework was used to enable the rendering of HTML templates, processing user
                    submissions, and storing data from the contact form into a CSV file. This core of the
                    application is found in the server.py file.</p>

                <p>In order to create a responsive frontend, on both desktop and mobile devices, I adapted
                    a HTML template that can render through the Flask framework. The use of HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript can be found within the web application.</p>

                <p>I then deployed the portfolio using PythonAnywhere, where its integration with Flask allowed
                    my portfolio to have a smooth deployment process that was now available online. I hope to
                    continue developing and adding additional features to the portfolio as I extend my skills
                    and hope to showcase further experiences. </p>
