# Starkie Phillips Portfolio

My portfolio has been deployed using pythonanywhere.com and can be found under the URL starkiephillips.pythonanywhere.com

I will continue to develop this as I improve on my skills and have further exciting projects to show!

Thank you for taking the time to look at my repository and explore my portfolio.

Latest update [27/11/2024] : I added form validations to the 'Get in Touch' section. This is so only submissions with a name, message, and email (with a valid email format) can be submitted. I noticed that with the native HTML error messages, it would still allow submissions that did not include a valid domain e.g. .com .de. And so, as well as the native error messages by HTML5, I have added additional email validations using the regex format. This is so if a user does not use the correct email format in any way, the form will not submit and an error message will display.
